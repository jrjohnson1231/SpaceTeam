CHANGELOG
---------
-**2/16/16 Scary :** start and stop.  Hey guys!  I'm done with the start and stop commands! I commented them up for you.  Let me know what you think!

-**3/16/16 Scary :** Tensor. Hey guys.  I made a tensor class.  It's really basic, just data for x,y,z coordinates and a basic conversion to polar.

-**3/20/16 Allie :** Planets. Hey! I made a very basic class for planets. Right now all it can do is find the force between two bodies, and the acceleration of a body. More to come on that. I also added a function to Tensor that finds the distance between two bodies. maybe I should put that in the Planets class? Let me know!

-**3/20/16 John :** Tensor/Planets. Hey guys, the dynamic memory was giving us some issues in the Tensor class so I got rid of it because it wasn't entirely necessary. Also included the Tensor class into the Planet class with Allie.

-**3/30/16 John :** I overloaded some operators in the tensor class, making the operations in planet much, much simpler.

TODO
----
- overall cleanup of code
- add update to tensor class

Meetings
--------
- **2/16/16 6:00-7:00**: Discussed project details and sent email to Professor Emrich outlining our ideas.
- **2/17/16 9:30-10:20(in-class)**: Discussed in more detail class hierarchy as well as analytical difficulty of n-body problem.
- **2/29/16 3:00-4:00**: Monday Lab (Allie and John) Came up with rubric and discussed where to begin.
- **3/14/16 3:00-4:00**: Monday Lab (Allie and John) Started LazyFoo SDL tutorials.
- **3/16/16 2:00-3:00**: Will focus on calculating coordinates and displaying separately. Will worry about user input while the program is running later on once we have things moving correctly on the screen. *Next Week:* Plan on having individual parts completed to create two body motion. *Two Weeks:* Plan on getting at least two bodies moving on a screen. Chris will work on SDL while John and Allie will work on physics behind motion. Decided to start having weekly meetings.
- **3/20/16 8:30-10:00**: John and Allie met and worked on Planets class. We got it working with Tensor and with 2 bodies with no initial velocity (basically just 2 bodies flying towards each other). Our To-Do list is above.

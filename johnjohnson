Did alot of work on simplifying formulas, and updating of position. Implemented staticvector containing pointers to each planet in order to keep track of all the planets. This enables the calcForce() function to be called once and then loop through the vector and add the forces for each planet. Tested driver program with third planet and qualitatively it appears to work.

Added name member to planet class and created static update function that updates all planets from driver with one call to update(). Driver program can also take command line argument dt.

Made Graphics Makefile that is compatable for mac and fixed a few linker issues. There is still a segfault in the graphic code which I am unable to find. Still need to clean up the repository and remove duplicate files.
